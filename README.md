## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal record of my spiritual practices. It is organized to help me keep track of the shlokas, rituals, and stotrams I practice daily, providing an easily accessible format for reference.

## Pronunciation Guide

The shlokas and stotrams are provided in **Sanskrit**, **IAST** (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) and **Plain English** to assist with proper recitation.

- **IAST**: A standardized system for the transliteration of Sanskrit into the Roman alphabet, used for accurate pronunciation.
- **Plain English**: A simplified guide for non-native speakers, helping with basic pronunciation.
