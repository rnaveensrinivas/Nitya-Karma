# Before any meal

For the karma yogi the offering is god, the oblation is god and it is god that offers it to the fire of god; in this manner, he realises god and reaches only Him.

This verse from the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 4, Verse 24) which means: Brahman is the name of the Lord, the cause of the whole creation। Looking at the whole creation as an effect, Brahman is seen as the cause of everything। The effect does not exist separate from its cause। This verse likens food that is eaten to an oblation poured into the fire during ritual। By chanting this prayer before meals, the food that is eaten is offered to Brahman, the Lord.

This Thiruppugazh Erumayil Eri was composed by Saint Arunagirinathar at Tiruvannamalai. It is supposed to be one of the Mangalams or the concluding slokas in Thiruppugazh. In this Tiruppugazh he praises the six faces of Lord Muruga and associates it with six deeds and requests Lord Muruga of Tiruvannamalai, to show the inner meaning of his six faces and help the saint realize the ultimate. The six deeds could also be associated with the six abodes of Lord Muruga. The six deeds specified are as below.

1. Mounted the peacock and sported around happily. The place referred to here is Tiruvavinankudi, a place at the foothill of Palani. Lord Muruga is supposed to have sported around this place mounted on his peacock. Lord Muruga's face is like that of a naughty small child.
2. Preached the meaning of "OM' i.e "True Knowledge" to his father Lord Shiva. The place referred to here is Swamimalai or Tiruveragam. Lord Muruga's face is like a learned scholar.
3. Resolved the issues of his devotees whoever called for Lord Muruga's help. The place associated with this could be Pazhamudhircholai, where he gives darshan along with Valli and Devayani and offers blessings to his devotees.Lord Muruga's face is full of kindness to his devotees.
4. Destroyed mount Krouncha with a single blow of his spear (VEL) and stood peacefully at this place. This place could be Tiruparamkundram ,where he married Devayani, the daughter of Indra after destroying Surapadman. Lord Muruga's face is peaceful and calm.
5. Destroyed Surapadman a demon using the VEL given by Goddess Parvati. The place referred to is Tiruchendur, where a vigorous fight resulted in destruction of Surapadman by Lord Muruga. Lord Muruga's face shows anger at its peak.
6. Comes in and marries Valli. The place where Lord Muruga got married to Valli is Tiruttani. Lord Muruga's face is full of love for Valli.

Thus the six deeds could be linked to the six abodes of Lord Muruga. This Tiruppugazh also has a inner meaning which can be interpreted as, Oh Lord Muruga residing in Tiruvannamalai, please mount the peacock in my mind, preach me the true meaning as you did to your father, kindly resolve my past karmas or deeds and with a single blow of your spear destroy my attachments and reservations, also destroy the demon in me and help me realize the ultimate.
